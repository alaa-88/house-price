# House Prices Fuzzy Expert System
This project implements a fuzzy expert system to predict house prices based on various features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, grade, and more. The system utilizes the Mamdani inference method to generate predictions.

## About the Expert System
The fuzzy expert system aims to predict the price of houses using the Mamdani inference method. It takes into account features such as sqft_living, grade, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_above, and sqft_basement to generate predictions.

## About Model

The expert system uses a fuzzy inference method called Mamdani to predict house prices based on input features. It utilizes fuzzy sets and rules to make predictions.

## Mamdani Inference

The Mamdani inference method is implemented using the scikit-fuzzy library. Fuzzy membership functions are defined for input and output variables, and fuzzy rules are established to infer house prices.
